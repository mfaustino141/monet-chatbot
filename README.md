## Chatbot Project

### Overview

- Welcome to our group project where we’ll be creating a Chatbot Monet! 
- The purpose of the bot is to offer an interactive way for art students and art enthusiasts to explore the Impressionist era. Designed with AI-generated dialogue mimicking Monet’s personality and insights, the chatbot can answer questions about key themes in Impressionism, such as the use of light, color, and spontaneous brushwork. 
- Users could ask Monet about the inspiration behind his iconic paintings like Water Lilies and Impression, Sunrise, or learn about the influence of outdoor ("en plein air") painting on the movement. With engaging anecdotes and explanations, the Monet chatbot transforms art history into a personalized learning experience, deepening users' understanding of how Impressionism challenged traditional artistic conventions and left a lasting impact on modern art.
